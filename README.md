# Data Structures - Binary Search Tree Operations
This is the Data Structures project which implements binary search tree and performs operations on it height of tree, number of nodes in tree, traversals etc.

In **A4Q1.cpp** the following operations are being performed
- Height of tree
- Number of nodes in tree 
- Number of leaf nodes in tree
- Number of non leaf nodes in tree
- Number of nodes in right tree 
- Inorder traversal of tree before deleting leaves                     
- Inorder traversal of tree after deleting leaves

In **A4Q2.cpp** we are performing
- Counting level nodes
- Finding out whether tree is balance or not
